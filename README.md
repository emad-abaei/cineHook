# 🎬 CineHook

CineHook is a modern movie search and watchlist application built with **React** and **TypeScript**. It allows users to search for movies, view details, and maintain a watchlist with ratings. The app fetches movie data from the **OMDb API** and provides a smooth, interactive experience with persistent local storage.

## 🙌 Credits & Inspiration

This project was originally inspired by a course from **Jonas Schmedtmann**. While the core idea comes from the course, I have made several enhancements, including:

- **Migrating from JavaScript to TypeScript** for better type safety and maintainability.
- **Implementing a mobile-friendly design** to improve responsiveness on smaller screens.
- **Refactoring and optimizing the codebase** for cleaner, more efficient development.

These improvements make **CineHook** a more robust and scalable movie search and watchlist application.
